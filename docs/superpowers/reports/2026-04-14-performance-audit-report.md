## Part 3 — Findings by Category

### Category 1: Re-renders

> **Why this matters:** Every unnecessary re-render executes the component's render function, diffs the virtual DOM, and potentially updates native views — burning JS thread budget and causing jank at 60fps.

#### Findings

**Pass 1 — Stores scan (2026-04-14)**

No active `useXxxStore()` calls without a selector function were found in any of the 39 store files. The codebase consistently uses granular selectors.

Two deprecated selectors were found in `stores/selectors/order-flow.selectors.ts` that subscribe to broader objects than necessary. Neither is actively consumed outside the selector definition and re-export files, so there is no current re-render impact — but the risk exists if they are picked up by future consumers:

- `stores/selectors/order-flow.selectors.ts:16` — `useOrderingData` returns the full `orderingData` object via `useOrderFlowStore((s) => s.orderingData)`. Any field within `orderingData` (items, voucher, type, table, delivery fields, etc.) changing would trigger a re-render in any consumer. Marked `@deprecated` in code — not currently consumed in `app/`, `components/`, or `hooks/`.
  **Severity:** Medium (dormant risk — deprecated but still exported; a future developer could import it)

- `stores/selectors/order-flow.selectors.ts:40` — `useOrderFlowCreateOrder` returns `{ orderingData, transitionToPayment }` via `useShallow` — the `orderingData` slot holds the entire object, so any nested field change (items, voucher, type, etc.) changes the `orderingData` reference and triggers a re-render in any consumer, despite `useShallow`. The replacement `useOrderFlowCreateOrderDialog` (line 49) correctly selects only specific primitives. Marked `@deprecated` in code — not currently consumed outside selector files.
  **Severity:** Medium (dormant risk — same as above)

- `stores/selectors/order-flow.selectors.ts:23` — `useUpdatingData` returns full `updatingData` object with no selector narrowing; active non-deprecated export — any `updatingData` nested field change re-renders all consumers.
  **Severity:** Medium (escalates from Low once consumed; currently no active consumer in app/, components/, or hooks/)

**Pass 2 — Hooks scan (2026-04-14)**

All `useEffect(..., [])` patterns in hooks were reviewed. No stale closure issues found. All empty-dep effects either:
- Only register listeners / `InteractionManager` tasks with no external variable capture (e.g., `use-screen-transition.ts:40`, `use-deferred-ready.ts:19`, `use-mobile.ts:14`)
- Are cleanup-only effects (e.g., `use-viewable-menu-prefetch.ts:76`)

No findings in Category 1 from Pass 2.

#### Pattern Guide

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong — re-renders on ANY store change
const { items, loading } = useCartStore()

// ✅ Correct — re-renders only when `items` changes
const items = useCartStore(s => s.items)
const loading = useCartStore(s => s.loading)
```

---

### Category 2: JS Thread Blocked

> **Why this matters:** React Native runs JS on a single thread. Synchronous heavy work (date calculations, large loops) during render blocks the thread, delaying touch responses and dropping frames.

#### Findings

**Pass 2 — Hooks scan (2026-04-14)**

No unmemoized date calculations found in hook render paths. All `new Date()` / `Date.now()` calls in hooks are either:
- Inside `useMemo` or `useCallback` (e.g., `use-predictive-prefetch.ts` uses `dayjs().format()` inside `useMemo`)
- Inside interval/event handler callbacks that only fire on demand, not on every render
- Module-level constants evaluated once at import time (`use-loyalty-point-history.ts:30-32`)

One borderline case noted for awareness:

- `hooks/use-countdown.ts:56` — `calcTimeLeft(expiresAt)` in the hook's return value recalculates `new Date(expiresAt).getTime() - Date.now()` on every render. This is intentional by design (the comment explicitly states "Derive seconds at render time") and the hook drives only a single text display — at 60fps this adds negligible cost. Not a performance concern in practice but documented for completeness.
  **Severity:** Low (intentional design, single lightweight calculation)

#### Pattern Guide

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong — new Date() called every render
function OrderCard({ expiresAt }: Props) {
  const timeLeft = new Date(expiresAt).getTime() - Date.now()
  return <Text>{timeLeft}</Text>
}

// ✅ Correct — memoized, only recalculates when expiresAt changes
function OrderCard({ expiresAt }: Props) {
  const timeLeft = useMemo(
    () => new Date(expiresAt).getTime() - Date.now(),
    [expiresAt]
  )
  return <Text>{timeLeft}</Text>
}
```

### Category 3: Memory Leaks

> **Why this matters:** Uncleaned timers and subscriptions keep running after a component unmounts, accumulating memory over time. On mobile this causes crashes after extended sessions and drains battery.

#### Findings

**Pass 1 — Stores scan (2026-04-14)**

One module-level mutable variable found in stores. No unguarded subscriptions (`subscribe`, `addListener`, `onSnapshot`) found in any store file.

- `stores/cart-legacy.store.ts:20` — `let _cartExpirationTimer: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null = null` at module level. This is a singleton timer that auto-clears the cart at midnight. The code does cancel the previous timer before scheduling a new one (lines 45–46) and nullifies itself after firing (line 49), so it is not an unbounded accumulation leak. However, it is a module-level mutable side-effect: the timer persists for the entire app lifetime once set, and there is no explicit teardown path if the store is cleared before the timer fires (e.g., after a forced logout). The store is still actively imported by `lib/store-sync-setup.ts` despite being named "legacy". If `clearCart()` is called externally without the timer being cancelled, the timer can fire and call `clearCart()` again on an already-cleared cart — a silent no-op but unexpected behaviour.
  **Severity:** Low (timer is properly managed for the normal case; risk is in edge-case teardown during auth transitions)

**Pass 2 — Hooks scan (2026-04-14)**

Two issues found in hooks. All `setInterval` users (`use-countdown.ts`, `use-animated-countdown.ts`, `use-qr-payment.ts`) and all `addListener`/`addEventListener` users (`use-back-handler-for-exit.ts`, `use-mobile.ts`, `use-navigation-bar-fixed.ts`, `use-qr-payment.ts`) have proper cleanup in their `useEffect` return functions. Two `setTimeout` calls lack cleanup:

- `hooks/use-debounced-input.ts:20` — `setTimeout(() => setIsLoading(false), delay)` is called inside a plain event handler (`handleInputChange`), not inside a `useEffect`. There is no cleanup path at all: if the component unmounts while the timer is pending (e.g., user leaves the search screen mid-typing), the callback fires and calls `setIsLoading(false)` on an unmounted component. React 18 silently suppresses the warning in production but the timer continues running, and if the component re-mounts quickly the stale callback can corrupt loading state during re-initialization.
  **Severity:** Critical — debounced input is used in search screens which are entered/exited multiple times per session; the stale timeout fires after unmount and on re-mount can corrupt the `isLoading` state, causing incorrect UI display or broken search interactions on rapid navigation

- `hooks/use-navigation-bar-fixed.ts:68` — anonymous `setTimeout(() => { setColor() }, 300)` inside the `AppState.addEventListener('change', ...)` callback has no handle stored and cannot be cleared. The outer `timeoutId` (line 61) is properly cleaned up on unmount, but this inner timeout created on every AppState `active` transition is fire-and-forget with no cleanup reference. On Android, if the component unmounts between the app going background→foreground and the 300ms delay expiring, the async `setColor()` call (which invokes the native module) runs against a detached component context.
  **Severity:** Low — Android-only, fire-and-forget native call; no state update triggered so no React memory corruption, but unnecessary native bridge call after unmount

- `hooks/use-notification-listener.ts:22` — `let cachedSound: Audio.Sound | null = null` at module level; on error in the catch block (line 38), the code sets `cachedSound = null` without calling `cachedSound.unloadAsync()` first, dereferencing the `Audio.Sound` instance without releasing the underlying audio session resource, leaking it until the app terminates.
  **Severity:** Medium — notification listener runs for the entire app session; audio session leak accumulates across errors (e.g., repeated notification sound failures), eventually exhausting audio session limits

#### Pattern Guide

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong — interval runs forever after unmount
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(tick, 1000)
}, [])

// ✅ Correct — interval cleared on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(tick, 1000)
  return () => clearInterval(id)
}, [])
```

### Category 4: Rendering Performance

> **Why this matters:** Unvirtualized lists render all items at once, bloating memory and slowing scroll. Non-memoized expensive components re-render on every parent update, wasting CPU.

#### Findings

_(populate from Pass 3 & 4)_

#### Pattern Guide

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong — FlatList renders all items
<FlatList data={products} renderItem={renderItem} />

// ✅ Correct — FlashList virtualizes with recycling
<FlashList
  data={products}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  estimatedItemSize={88}
/>
```
